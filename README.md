# Recipe-Website
This project is my application of essential concepts of HTML and CSS. It showcases my application of those concepts as well as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), including essential tags, transition, element state (hover, focus), element position (absolute, fixed, relative), and transitions and styling. This project doesn't include any JS or backend applications.
